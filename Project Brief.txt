PROJECT BRIEF:

---------------------------------
PLAN:
Create the classic game of snake but with extra features.

Feature ideas:
- convert dead snake into PShape
- create heatmap of where the snake has been
- draw mode
- create gui

How requirements are met:
    • Interactivity and motion for 1 minute - playing the game

    • Start and Reset Button/Trigger - reset key setting game values

    • Use mouse and keyboard events to change properties - gui / controls of other features

    • Must use at least 3 event listeners - not sure what this requires exactly

    • Must use good variable, function, class, and object names - no Explanation

    • Proper Encapsulation - Put all code for snake game into its own package and
        separated by class. Structuring rendering and gui may not be able to be packaged
        due to processing's logic execution. (correct interpretation of encapsulation?)

    • At least 1 custom PShape - dead snake feature.
-----------------------------------------
RISKS:

Snake:
- Tight coupling with Processing
    - collisions shouldn't depend on rendering
    - representing grid + collisions

Features:
- Converting snakes to PShape and not messing up X-Y values / sizes.
- Creating a massive file that's too hard to follow
    - creating a rediculous ammout of booleans to determine state
- Resizing screen may be impossible if a heatmap is to be implemented
- Handling all settings. (ie. mouse off when in game / on otherwise).
- Debugging - how to test in w/ processing
- How to create a heatmap?
